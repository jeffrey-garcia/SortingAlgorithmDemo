# SortingAlgorithmDemo

A Java applet to show (visually) the simple operation of simple sorting algorithms. The applet allows user to:
  
1. Select the algorithm to visualize - supports <b>Insertion Sort</b>, <b>Shell Sort</b>, <b>Quick Sort</b>, <b>Quick Sort</b> or <b>Merge Sort</b>
2. Select the initial state of the numbers to sort (increasing order, decreasing order, random order, and nearly sorted order)
3. Specify the speed of the visualization (step, slow, medium, fast)
4. The algorithm should animate the sorting by representing the array of data values to be sorted by a set of bars (one for each element in the array), the length of each bar proportional to the size of the data value stored in the corresponding array element
5. As the applet steps through the algorithm, any swap or move operation will be reflected by the appropriate change to the display of bars. If an algorithm uses particular indices to control the algorithm (such as left and right indices in the Quicksort algorithm) you may be able to mark these on the display and update them as part of animating the algorithm
6. The applet should have controls to allow you to control the animation of the algorithm, including controls to start, stop and pause the animation
7. During the animation of the algorithm, the applet should keep track of, and display, the number of comparisons performed, the number of swaps or copies of data values made, and, for Quicksort, the depth of the recursion
